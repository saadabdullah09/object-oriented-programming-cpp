## Overview

This lab focuses on revising core C++ fundamentals with emphasis on pointer manipulation, function usage, input validation, and problem-solving techniques.

All solutions are implemented using modular programming principles and proper use of functions where applicable.

---

## Topics Covered

- Pointer basics and dereferencing
- Double pointers
- Const with pointers
- Passing arguments by value and by pointer
- Pointer arithmetic
- Array manipulation using pointers
- String processing using character pointers
- Function overloading
- Menu-driven programs
- Conditional billing systems
- Sorting and searching without built-in functions

---

## Implementation Details

- Each question is implemented in a separate `.cpp` file.
- Functions are used wherever applicable.
- Input validation is applied where required.
- No built-in sorting or indexing shortcuts are used when restricted.
- All programs compile using standard C++ in Visual Studio.

## Objective

To strengthen understanding of pointer-based programming and reinforce foundational concepts required for advanced object-oriented design.
