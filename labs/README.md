# Labs – Object Oriented Programming (C++)

This folder contains all weekly laboratory exercises completed for the Object Oriented Programming course.

Each lab is organized in a separate subfolder and includes properly structured C++ programs that follow:

- Modular programming principles
- Function-based implementation
- Proper input validation where required
- Pointer usage and memory handling
- Clean and readable coding practices

## Lab Structure

Each lab follows this format:

lab-XX-topic-name/
- Individual .cpp files for each question
- A README describing the lab objectives

## Learning Focus

The labs are designed to strengthen understanding of:

- Classes and Objects
- Constructors and Destructors
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Encapsulation and Abstraction
- Function Overloading
- Pointer-based programming
- Problem-solving using C++

All programs are compiled using standard C++ in Visual Studio.
